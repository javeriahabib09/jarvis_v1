Welcome to Jarvis. Jarvis is a chatbot created to help you with finding a good movie recommendation. You can access the system at [https://t.me/Jarvis_MRSv1_bot](https://t.me/Jarvis_MRSv1_bot)

## Instructions

* To start the conversation, you can enter the following option:
  - /start
  - **Hi** or **Hello**
  - Ask any questions like *I want some romance movies from the 90s*

* The chatbot will ask you a few questions to find you a suitable movie. During the the conversation, the chatbot will provide you with buttons. For example,
  - If the user says **Give me some comedy movies**, the chatbot will display the buttons to remove the criteria of comedy movies.
  - If the user says **I want star war movies**, he/she can always press the button saying **I don't want "star war" movies**.
  - When the chatbot recommends a movie, you may have **watched it** or **don't like it**. Or you can ask **more about the movie**.
  - Even later, you can **ask for a similar movie** or **restart**.

Note: On the bottom of the keyboard, if the icon <img src="telegram-icons/keyboard.PNG" width="20" height="20"/> appears, you have the option to select from the buttons.


* If the agents asks for your preference, you have the option of not answering.
  - For example, if the agent asks "Do you have any favorite director?", you can answer "It doesn't matter", "I don't care", "Anything", "nobody", "none" etc.

* Type **/** or click on the icon <img src="telegram-icons/command.PNG" width="20" height="20"/> enter a command. The commands are:
  - /start : start a conversation
  - /restart : restart from scratch. The agent will forget whatever you said previously.
  - /help : get a list of instructions 
  - /exit : exit the recommendation. You can also say BYE in a humanly manner :smile:
